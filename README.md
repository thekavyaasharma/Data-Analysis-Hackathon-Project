# 📊 Data Analysis Hackathon Project 2026

A comprehensive data analysis project built for a hackathon, focused on exploring **biometric and demographic enrollment patterns** across Indian states and time periods. The project uses Python-based Jupyter Notebooks to uncover trends, distributions, and insights from enrollment data.

## 🔍 Analysis Modules

### 1. `biometric_state.ipynb`
Analyzes biometric capture rates (fingerprints, iris scans, photographs) broken down by Indian state — helping identify which states have the highest/lowest biometric coverage.

### 2. `biometric_date_state.ipynb`
A time-series + geographic analysis of biometric data, examining how biometric enrollment has evolved over time across different states.

### 3. `date_age enrollment analysis.ipynb`
Explores enrollment trends segmented by **age group and date**, revealing which demographics are enrolling at which times.

### 4. `demo state.ipynb`
Focuses on demographic breakdowns (gender, age) at the state level to understand population representation in the enrollment data.

### 5. `demo date vs state.ipynb`
Compares demographic patterns over time and across states — useful for identifying gaps or surges in specific regions or periods.

### 6. `enrol_state.ipynb`
Enrollment counts aggregated by state — a high-level overview of how many individuals have been enrolled per state.

### 7. `enrol bio demo.ipynb`
An integrated analysis combining enrollment counts, biometric capture completeness, and demographic factors for a holistic view of the dataset.
